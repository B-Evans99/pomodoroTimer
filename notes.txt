I chose to make a Pomodoro app. I've used the Pomodoro method, or close variations, before, and I've always been annoyed that the online or phone timers I use don't have the option to hide the ticking timer. I find it really stressful to not be able to check for /about/ how much time I have left in a session without seeing the precise second count ticking down.

Yesterday I made some initial sketches for the design. Along with the user stories in the initial challenge, I also want a show/hide button for the timer, and have set the stretch goal of storing whether there's a long break and the length of the work/rest sessions in the URL so users can bookmark their prefered settings.

There is a timer! My next step is to add in some control for the work/rest sessions.

---

The timer is almost entirely functional. My last step is to add functionality to toggle the option for long rests.

---

I've completed most of what I wanted to have done, with the exception of the url bookmarking feature.

Other things I would like to do:
    - The input boxes should have "minutes" somewhere.
    - Make the control icons hierarchical with size (make the play button bigger)
    - Add in different alarm noises
    - Tailor the phone design (everything is functional on mobile devices, but it could use tweaking)

---

I'm really happy with how the timer is looking and functioning. I've set my own Pomodoro work session and am going to see if I can finish the bookmarking feature in this time!

---

I cannot! There are query params in the URL that update based upon the session length values, but I wasn't able to read them to initialize the app.

I tested the app with a couple users. One user got confused when he set the timer to 0 minutes and completely skipped his work session. I've set it now so the mininum value the sessions can go down to is 1 minute. This means that when users set a 1 minute time, it's difficult to reset it to say, 5 minutes. Everyone was annoyed by that, but not confused, which was preferable to when the user didn't understand what he'd done to trigger a rest session.
