I chose to make a Pomodoro app. I've used the Pomodoro method, or close variations, before, and I've always been annoyed that the online or phone timers I use don't have the option to hide the ticking timer. I find it really stressful to not be able to check for /about/ how much time I have left in a session without seeing the precise second count ticking down.

Yesterday I made some initial sketches for the design. Along with the user stories in the initial challenge, I also want a show/hide button for the timer, and have set the stretch goal of storing whether there's a long break and the length of the work/rest sessions in the URL so users can bookmark their prefered settings.

There is a timer! My next step is to add in some control for the work/rest sessions.

The timer is almost entirely functional. My last step is to add functionality to toggle the option for long rests.
